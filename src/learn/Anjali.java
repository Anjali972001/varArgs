    /* classes are the named group of functions and properties.
    *  storing the 5 roll no.        int[] roll_no = new int[5]
    *  storing the 5 name .          String name = new String[5]
    *  storing the data of students. {roll_no, name }
    *  using the classes we can create our own data type ,but it will give  the error
       if we use the array to make our own datatype.
       student[] students = new student[5]; -----> will give an error.
     * suppose the car (is like a class) and it has the properties which every other types of class have
       like -- engine, price and no of seats.
     * types of the car is M,F,A.
     * car M has no of seats are 4 ; price is 10L and small engine
     * car A and F also have some properties .
     * **** A class is template of an object. And object is the instance of the class .
     * object is the real world entity.

     class ----> logical construct.
     object ----> physical reality(it is the actual thing that occupy the space in the memory)


      * object have three things : state  of  the  object
                                   identity of the object
                                   behavior of the object
                                   *
                                   *
       creating an object :-  student student1 = new student();
                   new is the keyword that dynamically allocates memory in heap area and returns a
                   value to it.
